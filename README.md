This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The Great Dogsby

Using The Dog API and either [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), make a simple React application with the following:

### Requirements

* A random image of a dog is displayed when the page is loaded
* A button that when clicked replaces the current image with a new dog image without reloading the page

### Bonus

* Center The Image and the button using CSS Grid
* Using CSS, give the button a flat color
* Using CSS, make every image take up the same amount of vertical space (the button shouldn't jump around as you request more dogs)
* Use Semantic HTML when structuring your page
